i wrote this back in 2022 when i was trying to figure out i'd do with my life if i could dream big.

I woke up in my treehouse as usual, light winking through the canopy (world’s best four-poster!). Winter’s coming and I’ll have to move indoors eventually, but I have a few more weeks. Even more if I get back to my cold exposure practice! I felt bright and alert—sleep’s good, thanks to the trees and outdoor temperature cycle. Of course,  I dialed in sleep ages ago, so it’s hardly worth mentioning, but I’m still grateful. 

One of my lovers is here too; the other’s off already. He's building another Ashapur and doesn’t want to waste energy travelling back and forth. We don’t use much energy these days; we live simply among the trees and suntowers. 

With permaculture system design and automation, I’ve built something like the Venus Project and it’s spread to most countries. Locals adapt it to the climate and culture but the idea’s the same: self-sufficiency and resource efficiency without asceticism. For a year of upfront work, people get almost all of their food produced regionally with minimal input—the food system sustains itself. What can’t be produced locally may be shipped if people must have international delights, but they often adapt to regional foods or find ways to synthesize/ferment/culture what they can’t grow. Technological advancement  makes it possible to grow more global foods locally too. Anyway, I’ve increased food security and nutritional availability for more than half the world while reducing the transportation footprint to almost nothing. 

People may still live lavishly—I’ve created abundance. This project would fail if it asked everyone to restrain themselves. Instead, I’ve made it easy, obvious, attractive, and satisfying to live within our planet’s means. 

This is especially possible because I’ve mostly replaced animal exploitation (I can’t change all places but I can make the alternatives cheaper, easier, and more attractive for the majority of the global population); those who still want animal products get them from precision fermentation, cell-based ag, etc.. And the remainder that delight in suffering and claim it’s only good when something died… I’ll deal with them eventually or accept 95% success. Besides economic methods, I make social change by creating activists—change the network, not the node.
