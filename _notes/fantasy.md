title: A Fantasy
---

Picture this. A tall guy, sturdy, real pretty. He’s got muscle but he’s soft too, like he works out but still has time to read. He’s my best friend and he loves to share what he’s learning. 

Today he’s talking about his current favourite poet, Rainer Maria Rilke. He settles beside me on the couch, slings an arm around my shoulders, and starts to read aloud from a library book. “This one’s called ‘Go to the Limits of Your Longing’.”

*“God speaks to each of us as he makes us,*  
*then walks with us silently out of the night.*

*These are the words we dimly hear:”*

He wets his lips and glances at me, eyes bright. His fingers play under my collar.

*“You, sent out beyond your recall,*  
*go to the limits of your longing.*  
*Embody me.”*

He reads the rest of the poem, then launches into his thoughts. What he likes about it, which lines stand out, what it reminds him of. A shivering web of ideas unfurls in my mind. It’s like I can see a little more truth at the core of things. I know exactly what it means even though I couldn’t explain, which reminds me of Leonard Cohen.

*“Oh, take this longing from my tongue, whatever useless things these hands have done...,"* I half-sing, half-say and pull him into my lap. His weight settles across my hips and I look up, way up, at his smirk. 

He quotes back to me, *“Let me see your beauty broken down, like you would do for one you love.”*

Broad hand on my throat, then in my hair, pulling my head back. He grinds down, lighting a flame that flares when he leans close and tells me he’s gonna unravel me with his voice alone. If I’m good he might ride me later.

I love that thought. I picture him shirtless, shoulders slick with effort, cute little skater skirt rucked up to the waist. “Femboy” collar, sharp jaw, smudged eyeliner. That intense look in his eyes like he zoomed in so far he can’t focus.

*Yank!* I’m back on the couch and he’s still got a fistful of my hair. “Not so fast," he says. "Let’s warm you up nice and slow…”

He hums the melody of “Take this Longing” and shifts ever so slightly. If I move against him he’ll stop, so I stay still, keep my gaze on his, and imagine his baritone rumbling below my navel. The honeyed sound sticks my thighs together.

“Tell me what you want.”

I want him to move. I want him to drape his arms over my shoulders and surround me. I want his breath in my ear and our chests pressed together so I can feel his voice and heartbeat as he talks me off. I want to flip us over and stick my fingers in his mouth.

“Yeah? Imagine me holding you, then. Every part of me pressed on you. It’s perfect but you want more.”

Yeah, I do. He’s big, he’s heavy, he’s everywhere, but he’s not close enough. I wanna squirm, I wanna tug his shirt up, I wanna take my shirt off. I want the sizzle of skin on skin, that moment when everything feels right.

“Mm-hmmm.” He sits back on my legs and looks me up and down, sees my thighs, my flush, the sliver of flesh where my tee rode up. “You’re gonna take that off real slow,” he says. “The hem’s gonna drag up your belly like my tongue. It’s gonna get stuck under your tits then they’re gonna pop free. Pull it over your head with both hands but don’t take it off all the way.”

I grin at him with my arms stuck in my hoodie behind my head and hit him with Doja Cat: “Should I keep my hands up, expression of fandom?”

He doesn’t answer. His eyes touch my lats, my high breasts, each collarbone in turn. He might as well be using his hands. The line of sensation draws up my neck, pauses on an earlobe, brushes my warm warm cheek, and stops at my mouth. I bite my lip, let it pop free, and flick my tongue out spit-slick and eager. I want a kiss so bad. His mouth’s plush and gentle, he kisses like he’s got all day, till suddenly he nips you and sticks his fingers in your mouth, pulls your face aside with a thumb hooked hard in your cheek. It’s like his poem said,
*“Let everything happen to you: beauty and terror.*  
*Just keep going. No feeling is final.”*

Just keep going. If only he’d get a move on. If only he’d actually kiss me instead of sitting there looking like he knows exactly what I’m thinking, like he knows that every moment he spends looking at me sends more desire bouncing around inside me, desire that has nowhere to go, nothing to do but echo and amplify. I’m starting to buzz.

“You can take that off now,” he tells me. 

I squirm the rest of the way out of my hoodie and squirm a little extra for relief, pressing up against his ass. He meets me with a slow grind, a lazy roll from left to right. Leans forward, chest brushes mine, head tilts back, throat works. He acts cool but he’s aching too.

I grab him by the collar and pull his shirt tight across his neck. It digs into the skin a little. “Off. Now.”

I let go long enough to let the shirt pass, then I’ve got his throat again. My thumb and middle finger barely reach the cord of muscle on each side. My grip is gentle, though. I nudge him forward and we finally touch, nose then mouth then chest, stomach, hips. Warmth pools at each point then spreads till I’m a puddle of sunshine and frission melting into his skin. 

We kiss languorously, lazily, lovingly. Sometimes we close our eyes, sometimes they’re open and I see through the ring of golden brown around his pupils to the galaxy soul behind. I smile and whisper,  
*“You, sent out beyond your recall,  
go to the limits of your longing.  
Embody me.”*
